# Padrino Assets

### Overview

Padrino assets is a plugin for the [Padrino](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework) web framework which makes use of the [Rack](https://github.com/rack/rack) plugin [Sprockets](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets) to manage and compile web assets.

### Setup & Installation

Include it in your project's `Gemfile` with Bundler:

``` ruby
gem 'padrino-assets'
```

Modify your `app/app.rb` file to register the plugin:

``` ruby
class ExampleApplication < Padrino::Application

  # make sure this line is BELOW "register Padrino::Helpers"
  register Padrino::Assets

  # put this line if your server ignores config.ru file
  # like "padrino start" do
  use Padrino::Assets::App
end
```

Modify your `config.ru` file to mount the environment:

``` ruby
map '/assets' do
  run Padrino::Assets.environment
end
```

By default, Sprockets is configured to load assets from your project's `app/assets` and `lib/assets` directories. Any files stored in these directories are readily available to the included helpers and will be served by the Sprockets middleware.

Because of this the following directories are no longer used and will instead be served statically:

* `public/images`
* `public/stylesheets`
* `public/javascripts`

You should now be storing your assets in the following directories:

* `app/assets/images`
* `app/assets/stylesheets`
* `app/assets/javascripts`

Should your project need to add additional paths you can do so by adding the following line:

``` ruby
Padrino::Assets.load_paths << 'path/to/my/assets'
```
